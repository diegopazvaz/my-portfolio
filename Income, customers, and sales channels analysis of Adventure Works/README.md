# 📊 Income, Customers, and Sales Channels Analysis – Adventure Works

🚴‍♂️ This project consists of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the sales of an international cycling products store (bikes, components, clothing, and accessories) using the Adventure Works DW 2020 sample model, along with a PDF explaining the actionable insights found.

## 🔹 Objective

The main goal of the dashboard is to generate actionable insights for a marketing manager, enabling quick decisions on advertising campaigns, customer loyalty, and sales strategies.

## 🗂 Dataset

The dashboard uses the Adventure Works DW 2020 sample model, which includes information on:

* Products and categories

* Customers

* Sales and income by country

* Sales channels (resellers and internet)

The model can be downloaded from: https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/dax/dax-sample-model

💡 What I did

* Creation of measures and calculated columns with DAX.

* Design of KPIs, line charts, bar charts, bubble maps, and dynamic cards.

* Use of interactive filters and slicers.

* Advanced formatting of measures (thousands, millions, percentages).

* Trend and seasonality analysis.

* Visual storytelling to transform data into strategic decisions.

## 📈 Highlighted Visualizations

* KPI of total revenue, unique and returning customers.

* Income distribution by category (donut chart).

* Income by country (bubble map).

* Sales channels (pie chart) and returning vs. unique customers (stacked bars).

 * Orders by month/year (line chart) and income distribution by channel (horizontal stacked bars).

## 🔍 Key Insights

🚴‍♂️ Bikes = 86.17% of sales ($94.62M), the star product.

🌍 U.S. = 49.02% of sales ($62.99M), followed by Canada and Australia.

📊 73% of sales come from resellers; e-commerce shows strong potential in the UK, France, and Australia.
